[Project: Design Teardown (with Smashing Magazine)](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/design-teardown)

In this simple project, you'll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you're probably familiar by now -- Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For inspiration, check out [this image from vanseodesign.com](http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/visual-hierarchy-compared.png) which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Your final product will look much like the site on the right.

This is also an opportunity to get better at positioning <div> elements without worrying too much about what's inside them, which will serve you well later.
